# Introduction #

This project will host a collection of views/widgets/controls that I needed for my android projects, but I couldn't find them build into the framework.
I hope, that in time, more widgets will be added to this project.


# Current Widgets #

  * **ThreasholdEditText** - same as the "standard" EditText, but with a new _OnThresholdTextChanged_ event added to the view that will be fired after a specific (configurable) delay from the last received input.
  * **DockPanel** - retractable panel that can be docked to any one of the screen sides. A custom button will allow the hiding and revealing of the panel.
  * **JoystickView** - this widget simulate an on-screen joystick functionality. This is an early release, and does not expose a customization interface yet.
  * **[Drag&Drop](Drag_and_Drop.md)** - not a widget, but an infrastructure that enable you to set any view on the screen as a "DropZone" and initiate any touch event as a "drag" session.
  * **TilesLayoutView** - this view is actually a new layout mechanism. It allows you to split the screen into predefined regions or "tiles" and switch between those presets at runtime with an animated effect.
